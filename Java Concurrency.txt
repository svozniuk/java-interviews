1. Describe synchronization in respect to multi-threading. What is synchronization.
	
	Several threads access common data. In order to keep the data in consistent state the access to it has to be synchronized (i.e. some ordering of data access has to be imposed).

2. Explain different ways of using thread?  

	a) Create a long-running computation in a separate thread so the user interface (or whatever other part of the application) is not blocked.
	b) separate out I/O operations which potentially can take a lot of time (e.g. reading from the network) for the same reason
	c) process incoming requests in parallel (usually using thread pool of some size)
	d) Create thread to do some kind of isolated processing, wait for the processing to finish, kill the thread. Create new threads when needed

3. What is the difference between preemptive scheduling and time slicing?
	
	Not exactly a correct question.

	A scheduler can be preemptive (it's capable to force a process to interrupt its execution and resume it in some time) and non-preemptive (which is unable to interrupt a process and relies on the processes themselves that voluntarily give control to other tasks). Time slicing is a usual technique to that is used in a preemptive multitasking system. The scheduler is run every time slice to choose the next process to run (it may happen that it's the same process during few time slices in a row, or it may happen that every time slice a different process is executed )

	To apply these terms to Java world -- replace the "process" with "thread", since the ideas behind scheduling processes in OS are the same as scheduling threads in an application.
	
4. When a thread is created and started, what is its initial state?

	The thread is then in "RUNNABLE" state. 

5. Thread vs Runnable, run() vs start()

	See below. The main difference between run() and start() is that the latter creates a separate thread while the former executes the code synchronously 

6. Describe different ways to create a thread.

	a) 
		class MyRunnable extends SomeOtherClass implements Runnable {
			public void run(){
				// code that has to run in a thread
			}
		}

		MyRunnable r = new MyRunnable();
		Thread t = new Thread(r);
		r.start();

	b) 
		class MyThread extends Thread {
			public void run(){
				// code that has to run in a thread
			}
		}

		Thread t = new MyThred();
		t.start();

	c)	
		class MySomething extends Something {
			public void doSomeStuff() {...}
		}

		new Thread(new Runnable() {
			public void run(){
				instanceOfMySomething.doSomeStuff();
			}
		}).start();

	The main difference between these two approaches is that in case (a) you are able to extend the class you need while still being able to run your code in a separate thread. In case (b) you are already extending from the Thread class which limits your options. In general following one of the good OOP practices (Favor composition over inheritance) option (a) is preferable. Option (c) is also cute since it decouples your class and the fact that its code will be run in a separate thread. In other words you can still call instanceOfMySomething.doSomeStuff() regardless from a new thread or from the same.

7. Synchronization of Java blocks and methods

	Methods declared synchronized and statements contained in synchronized blocks. Only one thread is allowed to be executing instructions inside a synchronized block. The main difference between synchronized block and synchronized method is that you can choose which object will be used for synchronization in case of blocks. The methods are always synchronized with "this"

8. Explain usage of the couple wait()/notify()
	
	The mechanism is used to allow one thread to signal another. E.g. Consumer signals that he's waiting for the next object to process, or Producer signals that a new object is ready to be processed.
	
    wait( ) tells the calling thread to give up the monitor and go to sleep until some other thread enters the same monitor and calls notify( ).
    notify( ) wakes up the a thread (a random one?) that called wait( ) on the same object.
    notifyAll( ) wakes up all the threads that called wait( ) on the same object. 


9. What does it mean Volatile keyword?

	The volatile keyword guarantees that reads and from a variable will see the changes made by the last write to this variable (and of course all other writes that happened earlier). Java documentation states that volatile establishes a "happens-before" relationship between a write to a variable and all subsequent reads from it.

10. java.util.concurrent.*, what utils do you know?
	
	Synchronization primitives: Semaphore, CyclicBarrier, CountDownLatch, Lock, ReentrantLock
	Threads: Executors, Callable and Future
	Data: Synchronized collections (CopyOnWriteArrayList, ConcurrentHashMap, BlockingQueue)

11. ThreadLocal, what for are they needed? Does child thread see the value of parent ThreadLocal?

	Values stored in Thread Local are global to the thread, meaning that they can be accessed from anywhere inside that thread. If a thread calls methods from several classes, then all the methods can see the Thread Local variable set by other methods (because they are executing in same thread). The value need not be passed explicitly. It’s like how you use global variables.

	One possible (and common) use is when you have some object that is not thread-safe, but you want to avoid synchronizing access to that object. Instead, give each thread its own instance of the object. ThreadLocals are one sort of global variables (although slightly less evil because they are restricted to one thread), so you should be careful when using them to avoid unwanted side-effects and memory leaks. Design your APIs so that the ThreadLocal values will always be automatically cleared when they are not anymore needed and that incorrect use of the API won't be possible (for example like this). 

	No. The child thread doesn't see the value of parent ThreadLocal unless InheritableThreadLocal<T> is used.

12. Recommendations to avoid deadlocks.

	a) We may create a class that will register all locks being held by all the threads. Thus before granting a new lock to a thread we may check whether it will not lead to a deadlock and grant the lock only if it doesn't.
	b) We may devise a policy of acquiring the locks by the threads that will guarantee a deadlock-free program. A simple example of such policy is: no thread is allowed to have more than one lock at a time.

13. What is daemon thread and which method is used to create the daemon thread?

	A daemon thread is a thread, that does not prevent the JVM from exiting when the program finishes but the thread is still running. An example for a daemon thread is the garbage collection. The setDaemon() method can be used to change the Thread daemon properties. Normal thread and daemon threads differ in what happens when they exit. When the JVM halts any remaining daemon threads are abandoned: finally blocks are not executed, stacks are not unwound - JVM just exits. Due to this reason daemon threads should be used sparingly and it is dangerous to use them for tasks that might perform any sort of I/O. 

14. What method must be implemented by all threads? 
	
	run(); by default (in the Thread class itself) it does nothing and returns

15. What is the difference between process and thread?

	From Java documentation: A process has a self-contained execution environment. A process generally has a complete, private set of basic run-time resources; in particular, each process has its own memory space. Most implementations of the Java virtual machine run as a single process

	Threads are sometimes called lightweight processes. Both processes and threads provide an execution environment, but creating a new thread requires fewer resources than creating a new process. Threads exist within a process - every process has at least one. Threads share the process's resources, including memory and open files. This makes for efficient, but potentially problematic, communication.

16. What are the states associated in the thread?

	http://www.science.uva.nl/ict/ossdocs/java/tutorial/java/threads/states.html

17. When you will synchronize a piece of your code?

	Whenever there will be a need: most probably when there will be concurrent access to some data

18. What is deadlock? Example of deadlock.

	Deadlock is a state in which some threads of an application (at least two threads) are mutually blocked (A waits for resource X held by B, while B waits for resource Y held by A). Neither can continue in this case. Note that only part of application can be in a deadlock state while other thread continue their execution.

	public class DeadlockTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        String s1 = "S1";
        String s2 = "S2";
        
        Thread t1 = new Thread(new deadlockCause(s1, s2));
        Thread t2 = new Thread(new deadlockCause(s2, s1));
        
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        
	    }
	}

	class DeadlockCause implements Runnable{

	    private final Object firstLock;
	    private final Object secondLock;
	    
	    public DeadlockCause(Object o1, Object o2) {
	        firstLock = o1;
	        secondLock = o2;
	    }

	    @Override
	    public void run() {
	        synchronized(firstLock){
	            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() +  " holds the lock on " + firstLock);
	            try {
	                Thread.sleep(1000);
	            } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
	                Logger.getLogger(deadlockCause.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, null, ex);
	            }
	            
	            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() +  " tries to get the lock on " + secondLock);
	            synchronized(secondLock){
	                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() +  " holds the lock on " + secondLock);
	            }
	        }
	    }    
	}

19. Are there any global variables in Java, which can be accessed by other part of your program?

	No, there are no global variables in Java. 

20. What are Callable and FutureTask interfaces?
	
	Motivation to create: with Thread and Runnable you cannot return a value as the result of executing the task. Additionally you have to process all the exception inside the run() method because its declaration is public void run() and doesn't allow exceptions to be thrown.
	The Callable has the method public T call() throws Exception. When an ExecutorService gets submitted a Callable<T> it returns a Future<T>. The get() method on this Future<T> instance has to be called in order to get the result

	Example:

	 ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool();
	 Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(new Callable<Integer>(){
	 	public Integer call() throws Exception {
	 		Integer result = 0;
	 		// do some stuff here
	 		return result;
	 	}
	 });

	 executor.shutdown(); // stop accepting new tasks

	 try {
	 	System.out.println("The result is: " + future.get());	 	
	 } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
	 	...
	 }

22. What is AtomicInteger

	AtomicInteger is a class from java.util.concurrent package that provides thread-safe implementation of an Integer.
